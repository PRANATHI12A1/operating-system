a)FCFS (First Come First Serve)

Aim: Write a C program to implement the various process scheduling mechanisms such as FCFS
scheduling.
Algorithm:
 Start the process
 Accept the number of processes in the ready Queue
 For each process in the ready Q, assign the process id and accept the CPU burst time
 Set the waiting of the first process as ‘0’ and its burst time as its turn around time
 for each process in the Ready Q calculate
 Waiting time for process(n)= waiting time of process (n-1) + Burst time of process(n-1)
 Turnaround time for Process(n)= waiting time of Process(n)+ Burst time for process(n)
 Calculate
 Average waiting time = Total waiting Time / Number of process
 Average Turnaround time = Total Turnaround Time / Number of process
 Stop the process
